#  Disable Customizer

_The  Disable Customizer plugin allows you to get the Customizer out of your WordPress install. It prevents any Customizer scripts from loading and removes all links and buttons to Customizer in the dashboard and admin toolbar._

### Installation

Upload the plugin to your WordPress plugins directory, or use the dashboard to 'Add New' plugins and activate it. That's it! No options needed. Customizer is gone.
